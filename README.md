# Plutos-Timeline
DLSU-D Planner Lite Application

🪐 Pluto's Timeline: DLSU-D Planner Lite
A specialized task management application built with Electron.js, specifically designed to apply core Discrete Mathematics concepts to academic planning.

🚀 Discrete Math Implementations

1. Sorting & Searching Algorithms

Merge Sort (O(nlogn)): Used to organize the Master Task List chronologically by due date. This demonstrates recursive partitioning and efficient time complexity.

Linear Search (O(n)): Powering the keyword-based search bar to filter assessments by professor, course, or task type.


2. Set Theory & Logic

Subsets: The application partitions the universal set of tasks into date-specific subsets for a clean calendar interface.

Predicate Logic: Search results are determined by evaluating if an element x satisfies the search criteria P(x).


3. Functions & Relations

Mapping Functions: Implements f:Assessment→Due Date, ensuring automatic placement and reminders.

Binary Relations: Establishes links between tasks, subjects, and professors.


4. Graph Theory

Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): The timeline acts as a DAG to ensure that module prerequisites and assessments are accessed in the correct logical flow.
